### Tere tere! 👋🇪🇪

I'm a full-stack developer currently living the dream in Tampere, Finland. 🇫🇮

Here's a little about me:

- 🔭 I’m currently working on bringing amazing front-end experiences to life, making sure users enjoy every interaction.
- 🌱 I’m diving deep into React Native and full-stack development – I love learning cool things in my free time!
- 🌍 Fun fact: I've lived in multiple countries and speak several languages – not just TypeScript! 🌐
- ⚽️ When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing football or out for a run. Staying active is my thing! Go Manchester United! 😁
- 💬 I believe in clean, understandable and time-safe code!
